# Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

Welcome to this repository where you'll find Python implementations of several fundamental machine learning classification algorithms coded scratch. 
This resource is designed for educational purposes to help understand the basic mechanics and underlying mathematics of popular classification algorithms.

This repository includes a few of the basic classification algorithms such as:

- **Decision Tree**: Uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It's simple to understand and interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.
  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies data based on the majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.

- **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, logistic regression is a linear model for binary classification that estimates probabilities using a logistic/sigmoid function.

- **Naive Bayes**: Based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, this method assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.
